      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ll occasionally browse [Hacker News[(https://news.ycombinator.com) or Lobsters for industry news. I typically find more value from subscribing to newsletters.
Newsletters The newsletter owners have done a great job of not spaming the list. Usually they arrive in the inbox on Sunday morning so it&amp;rsquo;s good timing to read them while relaxing with a cup of coffee. While there is some overlap in topics, the articles themselves don&amp;rsquo;t overlap.
Devops weekly Devops Weekly is a great collection of recent articles that cover topics like deployments, provisioning, observability, or even incident management.</description>

      <description>Who I&amp;rsquo;m Adam Faris and my pronouns are he,him,his. I work in computer operations at companies in the San Francisco Bay Area and live nearby. Presently I manage a data processing platform and work in a large on-premise Linux environment where we use Java, Python, &amp;amp; Go as application languages. The different langauges becomes an interesting mix of challenges in itself; along with the normal day to day problems.
Outside of work, I enjoy working with my hands by maintaining a vegatable garden and DIY home repair.</description>
