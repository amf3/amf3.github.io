      <description>Intro I have a small home lab that I use for testing differnet scenarios. Lately I have been choosing a distributed storage solution for use at home. Usually I look at industry and scale down the solution. This has lead to conversations with colleages and the question of &amp;ldquo;How did Amazon Web Services implement their Elastic Block Store offering?&amp;rdquo;.
Background There are solutions that provide network storage like iSCSI, CIFS, or NFS.</description>

      <description>Who I&amp;rsquo;m Adam Faris and my pronouns are he,him,his. I work in computer operations at companies in the San Francisco Bay Area and live nearby. Presently I manage a data processing platform and work in a large on-premise Linux environment where we use Java, Python, &amp;amp; Go as application languages. The different langauges becomes an interesting mix of challenges in itself; along with the normal day to day problems.
Outside of work, I enjoy working with my hands by maintaining a vegatable garden and DIY home repair.</description>
