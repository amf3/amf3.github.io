### Who

I'm Adam Faris and my pronouns are he,him,his. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, I have a strong background
in computer operations, with experience managing data processing platforms and working in large on-premise Linux 
environments where languages like Java, Python, & Go come into play.

Outside of "work," you'll find me in my vegetable garden or tackling DIY home repair projects â€“ both of which
bring me a sense of accomplishment.

### What

This is a place to share findings that could be useful or interesting to others.
It may also contain notes to myself as a reference in the future.  Topics will range from large
installation systems administration to home labs and embedded devices.

### Why

I started working with data processing platforms in 2011.  It amazed me at how open
the data community was with sharing ideas and how quickly software changed for the better because of it.
With this site, I'd like to carry on that tradition of sharing ideas and findings.
