### Who

I'm Adam Faris and my pronouns are he,him,his. I work in computer operations at companies in the 
San Francisco Bay Area and live nearby.  Presently I manage a data processing platform and work in a
large on-premise Linux environment where we use Java, Python, & Go as application languages. The 
different langauges becomes an interesting mix of challenges in itself; along with the normal 
day to day problems.

Outside of work, I enjoy working with my hands by maintaining a vegatable garden and DIY home repair.

### What

This is a place to share findings that could be useful or interesting to others.  
It may contain notes to myself as a reference in the future.  Topics will range from large
installation systems administration to home labs and embedded devices.

### Why

I started working with data processing platforms in 2011.  What amazed me is how open
the data community was with sharing ideas and how quickly software changed from it.  In-person meetups 
were both frequent and crowded with great presentations.  

With this site, I'd like to carry on that tradition of sharing ideas and findings.
