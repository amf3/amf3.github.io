## Intro

I'll occasionally browse [Hacker News[(https://news.ycombinator.com) or [Lobsters](http://lobste.rs) for industry news. I typically find more value from subscribing to newsletters.  

## Newsletters

The newsletter owners have done a great job of not spaming the list. Usually they arrive in the inbox on Sunday morning so it's good
timing to read them while relaxing with a cup of coffee.  While there is some overlap in topics, the articles
themselves don't overlap.

### Devops weekly

[Devops Weekly](https://www.devopsweekly.com) is a great collection of recent articles that cover topics like deployments, provisioning,
observability, or even incident management.

### Monitoring weekly

[Monitoring Weekly](https://monitoring.love) is another great list.  As implied by its name, it's focus is on monitoring & observability.

## Blogs

* [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca) A great blog to follow as it covers both technical & career disucssions.
* [Charity Majors](https://charity.wtf) Another blog that covers technical & career discussions

## Books

The following is a list of of books that I've found helpful.

* Working Effectively with Legacy Code, Michael C Feathers
* The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, Robert C Martin
* Linux Kernel Development: Robert Love
